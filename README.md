# fsquared-core

This is a bare-bones Hugo theme, which does some very basic setup for handling
assets and includes PureCSS.

It's intended to function as a foundation on which to build, and not a complete
solution.


## Features

* includes [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/)
* automatically links any CSS assets (in `assets/css`)
* automatically links any JS assets (in `assets/js`)
* automatically builds and links any SASS assets (in `assets/scss`)


## Installation

Clone this repo into your `themes` directory (or copy it), and add

	theme = 'fsquared-core'

in your `hugo.toml`.


## Configuration

None.
